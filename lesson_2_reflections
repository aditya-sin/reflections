What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initialising a repository creates a .git file which contains metadata
about history of repositroy, however it is empty, and no commits are 
created. It is needed for later action when commits will be created. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is like an intermediate bwetween working directory and 
repository. It helps in creating commits by making the process more 
manageable.
